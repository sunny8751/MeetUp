# MeetUp


Meet up with friends with a tap of a button!
MeetUp is a mobile app that allows you to organize casual events with friends to hang out, get lunch, start a pickup basketball game, etc. You can also organize more official events such as ski trips and international travel plans.

Within the app, you can see what your friends (or people nearby) are up to and join them.

# Implementation

This app is implemented in ReactNative in order to cater to both Android and iOS phones while cutting down on development time and costs.
